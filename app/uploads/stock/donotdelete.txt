This is just a place holder file it ensures that 
this folder gets created on the remote repo and
on heroku or rather it will be counted as part of the app slug

essentially they will have served their purpose, they are meant for 
uploading stock information into the database.

Having said that DO NOT DELETE THIS FILE
